=========

LearRead is a tools that will help You to learn english. A nice way to learn it is by reading,
unfortunatelly You have to know a lot of words to fully understand a book. LearRead helps You to learn
words used in a book before reading it so that You can enjoy it more.

Currently it can only save a list of words that You think You know, and analyze a book or any other document(currently only txt format) and list words that you probably do not know. You can then analyze the list, add any words You know to the your list of words, and the ones You don't to Anki (see https://github.com/maciejklimek/AnkiCreator for a convenient way to add words to Anki).
